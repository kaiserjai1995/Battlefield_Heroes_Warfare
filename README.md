# Battlefield Heroes Warfare v1.0

An open world game created using Ruby with the aid of the Gosu Library.

### Prerequisities

```
1. Latest Version of Ruby
```
```
2. A bash CLI (for Windows) eg. CYGWIN, MINGW. Not needed for Linux.
```
```
3. Ruby Gems
```
```
4. ImageMagick
```

### Installing

```
1. Install all ruby gem dependencies via Bundler or by manually installing them one by one
```
```
2. Browse through the 'game' folder directory and find main.rb.
```
```
3. Run the game by entering ruby main.rb on the CLI. If error occurs, check if all dependencies have been installed.

OR

You could run the game through OCRA (gem install ocra). To run just enter ocra main.rb from the game directory. This will compile and run the game, however dependencies need to be installed first.
```
```
4. Enjoy the game!
```

### Apologies

The programmer couldn't compile the codes into a single executable file due to constraints from the ImageMagick and RMagick software, most especially in Windows.
